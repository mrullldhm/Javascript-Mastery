// npm is a tool that help install open-source package, manage dependencies, run scripts to automate task

// Purpose
// Instead of writing everything from scratch, you can use pre-built code from other developers.

// How it works
// You run npm install package-name to add a library.
// It saves those libraries in a folder called node_modules.
// It also updates a file called package.json, which keeps track of your projectâ€™s dependencies.

// Example
// npm install react
